# Devops-test

This page outlines the steps taken to implement a CD pipeline for the BuildIT Devops test - see [BuildIt DevOps Test](README_BUILDIT.md).
Any changes made to the _feature_ branch of this repository will trigger the pipeline resulting in deployment of the sample
web app to a HA environment on Digital Ocean.
